# Documentation

I started this project to build on previous project I made, i.e. GameBoy Emulator, GameBoy Cartridge Reader, GameBoy Zero. This seemed to me as a good fit for the 2 semester project I had to make in my university course in embedded autonomous systems in my master of engineering in electrical engineering at the University of Applied Sciences Landshut. I started off the first semester alone and we continued with two students in the second semester. At the university we had to write projects reports, which can be found as documentation in the `project_reports/` folder. However, the project report are in german. More english documentation may follow.
